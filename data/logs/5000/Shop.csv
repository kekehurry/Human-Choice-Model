Considering the choices of people with similar profiles in Boston, walking is not a common mode of transportation due to the city's dense layout and cold climate. Public transport might be an option for those who do not own cars, but given the person's ownership of multiple vehicles, this seems unlikely as well. However, car usage could be influenced by factors such as the need for frequent trips or transporting family members. Given these considerations, I think the most likely transportation modes include walking, public transport, and especially car given the profile of owning more than three vehicles."",
