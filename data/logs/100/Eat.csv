Note that option3 (""		:"") was not provided initially, so I had to add it (Food delivery/pickup) to cover some other possible options, but also considering that usually this kind of people with financial constraints are more likely to avoid such expensive options and Home cooking is less probable because the person live alone. The cultural context of Boston favors walking and cycling as modes of transportation, which might influence the choice for eating out as well. As a result, I gave higher weights to Walking and Public transport in this scenario.
